# What Do You Want From Me? Adapting to the Uncertainty of Human Preferences

## Pre-requisites

This code needs Python 2.7.
Since it relies on Gambit 15, you need to [build Gambit from source](https://gambitproject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build.html#)
as well as its [Python extension](https://gambitproject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build.html#building-the-python-extension).
